Having this dataset in Liongard would help us solve a couple huge gaps with this particular product.

Brightgauge Dashboard Reporting. There has never been very good reporting out of this tool, and the fact that the mailboxes (active users) are part of the configuration would allow us to provide active user metrics for our managed orgs in this system.

Alerting. We deal with lots of challenges simply due to misconfigurations that don't follow best practices. Liongard's metric and alert technology make it possible to notify teams when an tenant's settings are incorrect.

Documentation. Auto docs in IT Glue help non technical staff quickly access detailed system information.
